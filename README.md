[![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/devth/k8s-labeler.svg?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/devth/k8s-labeler/)

Intended to be used as an init container for a Kubernetes pod.

## Usage

Set a `KUBE_NAMESPACE` env var in the Docker container.

Any env vars containing `KUBE_LABEL_` will be applied to the pod as labels via
the API. For example:

```bash
KUBE_LABEL_hostname=foobar
```

Would result in a label `hostname: foobar` on the pod.

This can be useful for setting properties from the [Downward
API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/)
as labels (e.g. exposing a unique label for each pod in a stateful).

## Run locally

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Kubernetes example

This init container sets a `hostname` label equal to the pod's name:

```yaml
initContainers:
  - image: devth/k8s-labeler
    name: labeler
    env:
      - name: KUBE_NAMESPACE
        valueFrom:
          fieldRef:
            fieldPath: metadata.namespace
      - name: KUBE_LABEL_hostname
        valueFrom:
          fieldRef:
            fieldPath: metadata.name
```

Inspect the pod with:

```bash
kubectl get pod -l app=myapp --show-labels

NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS
myapp-2768796676-c702s   2/2       Running   0          25m       app=myapp,hostname=myapp-2768796676-c702s,pod-template-hash=2768796676
```

And notice that the `hostname=myapp-2768796676-c702s` label is present.
